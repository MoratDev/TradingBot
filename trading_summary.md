## Algorithm Overview
- **Model**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Training Period**: 2015-2020 (6 years)
- **Testing Period**: 2021-2025 (4.5 years)
- **Features**: 22 technical indicators including:
  - Price movements and ratios
  - Moving averages (5, 10, 20, 50 days)
  - RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands
  - Volume indicators
  - Volatility measures (ATR)
  - Lagged features

## Training Results
- **Training Samples**: 1,461 days
- **Validation Accuracy**: 49.83%
- **Positive Samples**: 54.62% (slightly bullish bias in training data)

## Backtest Performance (2021-2025)
- **Initial Capital**: $10,000
- **Final Portfolio Value**: $13,285.53
- **Total Return**: 32.86%
- **Buy & Hold Return**: 58.92%
- **Excess Return**: -26.06% (underperformed buy & hold)
- **Sharpe Ratio**: 0.5112
- **Number of Trades**: 350

## Key Insights
1. **Model Performance**: The Random Forest achieved ~50% accuracy, which is expected for financial prediction tasks due to market efficiency
2. **Feature Importance**: Lagged returns and volume ratios were the most predictive features
3. **Strategy Underperformance**: The ML strategy underperformed buy & hold by 26%, likely due to:
   - Transaction costs not modeled
   - Market regime changes between training and testing periods
   - Overfitting to historical patterns

## Most Important Features
1. Returns_lag_3 (5.7%)
2. Returns (5.4%)
3. Volume_Ratio_lag_1 (5.4%)
4. Returns_lag_1 (5.2%)
5. ATR (5.1%)
